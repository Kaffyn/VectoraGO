---

**Traditional RAG operates on isolated chunks.
Vectora operates on real system relationships.**

- semantic search (embeddings)
- code structure (files, functions, dependencies)
- codebase graph
- multi-hop reasoning

Result: answers based on how the system actually works — not just on isolated snippets.

---

- **Hybrid RAG (Core):** Semantic + structural + relational retrieval with **USearch (HNSW)**
- **Codebase-Aware:** Understands real relationships between modules and files
- **Real Multi-hop:** Navigates multiple points in the system to answer complex questions
- **Agentic Execution:** Acts on code with context and safety
- **TurboQuant:** Extreme vector compression for memory efficiency
- **Premium TUI (Charmland):** Immersive CLI Command Center with rich visuals and interactive wizards
- **Total Privacy:** Data and embeddings stay local
- **Flexible Hosting:** Run locally for free (BYO Keys) or as a managed Service (AI Credits)

---

## Why Vectora?

Most solutions require combining multiple tools:

- vector database (**USearch**)
- RAG framework
- embeddings
- orchestration
- compression (**TurboQuant**)

Vectora integrates all of this into a single local core, ready for use.

---

## 🚀 Two Modes of Operation

Vectora is built with flexibility in mind, offering two distinct ways to power your AI:

### 1. Local-First & Free (BYO Keys)
Run everything directly on your local machine.
- **Cost:** 100% Free (Open Source core).
- **Privacy:** Your vectors and metadata never leave your drive.
- **Requirements:** You provide your own API keys (Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).
- **Best for:** Developers, power users, and air-gapped environments.

### 2. Managed Vector Service (Paid + Credits)
Connect to the Kaffyn cloud service for a seamless experience.
- **Cost:** Paid subscription or pay-as-you-go credits.
- **Convenience:** No need to manage your own API keys or quotas.
- **Future-Proof:** Enables advanced features like the upcoming **Vectora Mobile** application.
- **Best for:** Teams, non-technical users, and multi-device synchronization.

---

## Agentic Operation: Specialized Sub-Agent for your IDE

Vectora acts as a **Sub-Agent (Tier 2)** coupled to your IDE, designed to execute complex tasks based on a real understanding of the codebase.

While the main agent (Tier 1) orchestrates user interaction, Vectora takes on tasks that require **deep retrieval, structural analysis, and controlled execution**.

- **High-Level Delegation:**
  The IDE can delegate operations such as multi-file refactorings, impact analysis, and dependency navigation. Vectora executes based on the actual state of the code.

- **Context-Aware Execution:**
  All actions are guided by contextual retrieval (RAG), ensuring that reads, writes, and commands are based on the actual structure and relationships of the project.

- **Scope-Restricted Execution:**
  Tools operate exclusively within the Trust Folder, ensuring predictability and isolation.

- **Transactional Security (Git Snapshots):**
  Code modifications are preceded by automatic snapshots, allowing for immediate reversion.

---

## Retrieval Engine: Systemic Understanding of the Codebase

Traditional RAG operates on isolated chunks.
Vectora retrieves **connected context**.

- **Retrieval Layers:**
  Combines semantic search (embeddings) with structural code analysis (files, functions, modules, and dependencies).

- **Codebase Graph:**
  The project is modeled as a graph of relationships between entities, allowing for navigation beyond file boundaries.

- **Multi-hop Reasoning:**
  Queries traverse multiple points in the system, connecting dependencies and execution flows to answer questions that require global context.

---

## Installation and Integration

Vectora is designed to adapt to your workflow:

**1. Portable Binary (Manual & MCP Server):**

Ideal for full control or usage outside of IDEs.

- **Download:** Download `vectora.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Kaffyn/Vectora/releases) page.
- **CLI Mode:** Interactive interface for indexing and quick semantic searches via terminal.
- **MCP Server Mode:** Configure the binary path as an MCP server for tools like **Claude Desktop**, **Claude Code (CLI)**, and **Gemini CLI**. The core communicates via **stdio**, exposing its agentic arsenal to any compatible client.

**2. IDE Extensions & CLI Clients:**

- **VS Code Extension (Agent & Sub-Agent Mode):**
  - **Agent Mode:** Full interactive experience with a dedicated chat panel, tools, and visual feedback directly in your IDE.
  - **Sub-Agent Mode:** Integrates natively as a specialized code-reasoning engine that can be invoked by the main chat or other agents (like **Antigravity**) to handle complex, repo-wide tasks.
  - **Bundled:** The extension includes the Vectora Core binary; no separate download required.

- **Gemini CLI (Sub-Agent Mode):**
  - **Integration:** Operates exclusively as a **Sub-Agent** for the Gemini CLI. By exposing its RAG and agentic arsenal via MCP, Vectora allows the Gemini CLI to understand and act on complex codebases natively.

- **Claude Code (Sub-Agent Mode via MCP):**
  - **Integration:** Connect Vectora as a specialized code analysis and RAG engine via the MCP (Model Context Protocol).
  - **Setup:** Configure `~/.claude/settings.json` to add Vectora MCP server. No extension required.
  - **Capabilities:** Vectora exposes 11 specialized tools including semantic search, pattern analysis, test generation, and code refactoring.
  - **Documentation:** See [CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md](CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md) for complete setup instructions and examples.

## SDKs & Protocols

Vectora relies on three foundational integration pillars for maximum scalability and enterprise stability:

### 1. Orchestration Protocols (ACP & MCP)

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Context-focused operation. Enables Parent Agents (like Claude Code or Antigravity) to use Vectora as a deep-search and RAG Sub-Agent.
- **ACP (Agent Client Protocol):** Action-focused operation (JSON-RPC over stdio). Vectora directly connects VS Code extensions (Agent) or CLI to the Core with zero overhead.

### 2. Provider Models SDKs

The Core natively implements complex parsers (streaming, tool calls) in Go through the strict adoption of official SDKs, ensuring maximum reliability:

- **google/genai** (Gemini 3.1 Pro, Flash, and Embedding 2.0)
- **anthropic-sdk-go** (Claude 4.6 Sonnet/Opus, Claude 4.5 Haiku)
- **openai-go** (GPT-5.4 Pro/Mini, Qwen 3.6 API interoperability, Text Embeddings 3)
- **voyageai** (Advanced Voyage-3 Large/Code Embeddings)

### 3. Supported AI Families (Standard April 2026)

Vectora is designed to work with the 10 most powerful AI families on the market:

| Family         | Frontier Models (2026)                   |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Google**     | Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemma 4  |
| **Anthropic**  | Claude 4.6 Sonnet/Opus, Claude 4.5 Haiku |
| **OpenAI**     | GPT-5.4 Pro, GPT-5.4 Mini, GPT-5-o1      |

### 4. Multi-Tenancy Protocol (MTP)

The Core runs as a **Singleton Daemon** in the background, consuming minimal RAM. Opening multiple IDEs does not spawn multiple Vectora processes; instead, the architecture handles concurrent environments through the _Multi-Tenancy Protocol_, establishing shielded Namespaces bound per IPC connection, balancing AI request queues in isolated scopes, and protecting Trust Folder boundaries.

---

## Quick Start (CLI Cobra)

```bash
# 1. Start the core in the project folder
vectora start

# 2. Configure your key (Ex: Gemini)
vectora config --gemini YOUR_KEY

# 3. Generate embeddings
vectora embed

# 4. Ask about the code
vectora ask "How does authentication work?"
```

## Privacy and Control (Trust Folder)

- **Master Directory (Config):** Your global settings, logs, and API keys stay isolated in %USERPROFILE%/.vectora.
- **Trust Folder (Scope):** By default, the location where you run **Vectora Core** is your "Trust Folder". The core will only have permission to read or modify files within this scope.
- **Repositioning:** If you want to grant access to another location on the system, use the --path flag via CLI (e.g., vectora start --path D:\MyProject) to reposition the trust folder.
- **Hard-Coded Guardian:** Even within the Trust Folder, Vectora automatically ignores sensitive files like .env, .key, and .pem.

---

## Agentic Toolkit (Industrial Grade)

Exposed via MCP/ACP and built from scratch in Go, the Agentic Toolkit is the arsenal of tools that transforms Vectora from a simple chatbot into an operational agent capable of directly interacting with your system — always within the Trust Folder and with transactional security.

### File and System Tools

- **`read_file`:** Precise reading of individual files with line pagination support for large files.
- **`write_file`:** Complete writing of new files or controlled overwrite (with automatic Git snapshot).
- **`read_folder`:** Recursive directory listing with structure metadata (size, modification, permissions).
- **`edit`:** Intelligent patching — refined editing of specific snippets without rewriting the entire file. Locates the exact context via semantic search-and-replace and applies surgical changes.

### Search and Retrieval Tools

- **`find_files`:** Fast search using glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`) with name and extension filtering.
- **`grep_search`:** Powerful ripgrep-based search with full regex support, file type filtering, and result limiting.
- **`google_search`:** Web search integration to bring in up-to-date external context — ideal for recent documentation, changelogs, and troubleshooting.
- **`web_fetch`:** Direct URL fetching, converting HTML to markdown and extracting the relevant content for the conversation context.

### System and Terminal Tools

- **`run_shell_command`:** Shell command execution in a controlled environment with real-time stdout/stderr capture. Supports background execution for long-running processes and configurable timeout.

### Memory and Planning Tools

- **`save_memory`:** Persistence of important facts and user preferences in long-term memory (global or per-project), enabling continuous personalization across sessions.
- **`enter_plan_mode`:** Activation of structured planning mode — before executing complex tasks, the agent elaborates a step-by-step plan, validates it with the user, and only then begins implementation.

### Security and Isolation

All tools operate exclusively within the user-defined **Trust Folder**. The **Hard-Coded Guardian** automatically blocks reading/writing of sensitive files (`.env`, `.key`, `.pem`, databases, binaries), regardless of the model's intelligence or prompt instructions.
